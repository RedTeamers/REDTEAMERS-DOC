# Outsider Initial Access

The **outsider perspective** represents the most common entry point for real-world attackers.  
An outsider has **no legitimate access** to the organization but leverages open-source intelligence, exposed data, and underground economies to gain an initial foothold.  
In the modern threat landscape, **data leaks and access markets** have become one of the most powerful enablers for this phase.

## The Economy of Leaks and Initial Access

Over the last decade, **stolen credentials and corporate access** have evolved into a full-fledged underground economy.  
Instead of relying solely on custom exploits, many attackers now **purchase ready-to-use access** on dedicated platforms known as **Initial Access Brokers (IABs)**.

These marketplaces sell **credentials, VPN sessions, RDP access, and even entire domain admin accounts** obtained through:

- **Infostealer malware** (Raccoon Stealer, RedLine, Vidar, Lumma, etc.)  
  → harvesting browser-stored credentials, cookies, and session tokens.  
- **Phishing campaigns**  
  → collecting valid logins directly from users.  
- **Database breaches**  
  → password reuse becomes an easy path to corporate compromise.  
- **Compromised infrastructure**  
  → misconfigured Citrix, exposed VPNs, weak RDP.

For a Red Team, monitoring and simulating this ecosystem provides a **realistic attack surface**.

## Key Marketplaces and Access Brokers

Although many platforms are volatile (shut down or rebranded), some **persistent names** have shaped the underground access economy:

- **Russian Market**:  
  Specializes in **logs from infostealers**. Operators can search by domain (e.g., `company.com`) and instantly purchase credential sets including cookies, browser fingerprints, and saved passwords. This is one of the fastest ways to simulate realistic credential theft.

- **Genesis Market** *(taken down, but clones exist)*:  
  Famous for selling **bot profiles** — full browser fingerprints and cookies allowing attackers to bypass MFA by impersonating a victim’s session. Even though the original was dismantled, several copycats (e.g., *Genesis 2.0*) continue to circulate.

- **2easy Shop**:  
  Known for its **cheap, massive supply** of logs. While less curated, it demonstrates the scale of access available to attackers with minimal investment.

- **Private IAB forums**:  
  Beyond public shops, some brokers operate in invite-only channels (Telegram, XMPP, closed forums). They sell higher-value accesses such as **domain controllers, corporate VPNs, or even cloud admin panels**.

⚠️ For a Red Team operator, **simulation is the priority**.  
Actual purchase of illegal access is not necessary; instead, teams may:  
- **Use OSINT** to replicate what is available.  
- **Leverage pre-collected leaks** (public breaches, corporate credential dumps).  
- **Emulate the workflow** of searching and using stolen data, without crossing into criminal acquisition.

## Practical Red Team Techniques with Leaks

1. **Credential Validation**  
   Once credentials are obtained (from leaks or simulated markets), the first step is to validate them safely:  
   - Test against **corporate VPN / webmail portals**.  
   - Check **password reuse** across exposed accounts.  
   - Use **password spraying** with leaked patterns (e.g., `Winter2024!`, `Company@123`).  

2. **Cookie and Session Replay**  
   Infostealers often expose cookies (Google Workspace, O365, Salesforce).  
   - Red Teamers can replay sessions to simulate **MFA bypass**.  
   - Browser profile emulation tools can mimic a stolen fingerprint.  

3. **Targeted Enumeration in Leaks**  
   - Searching leaks by **email domain** (`@company.com`).  
   - Looking for **executive accounts** (CEO, CFO) to simulate whaling.  
   - Identifying **technical staff accounts** (admins, developers) which often have privileged access.  

4. **Combination with OSINT**  
   Leaks become exponentially more valuable when correlated with OSINT:  
   - Cross-matching **LinkedIn employee lists** with breach data.  
   - Identifying developers on **GitHub** and checking their credentials in leaks.  
   - Using Shodan/Censys to link leaked accounts with exposed services.

## Red Team Scenarios

A realistic outsider-to-insider path often looks like this:

- An attacker finds **employee credentials** on a leak marketplace.  
- The password is reused on the company’s **VPN gateway**.  
- With VPN access, the attacker reaches internal systems.  
- From there, **enumeration and lateral movement** begin.  

Or alternatively:

- Cookies from Russian Market allow bypassing MFA on an O365 account.  
- The attacker gains access to **corporate emails and OneDrive**.  
- Sensitive documents are exfiltrated without triggering credential alerts.  

These are not abstract possibilities — they are **daily realities** in the access broker ecosystem.  
By simulating them, a Red Team provides defenders with **true-to-life training** and highlights how a single leaked credential can unravel an entire security posture.

## Defensive Insights

From a Blue Team perspective, defending against this ecosystem requires:

- **Continuous leak monitoring** (dark web, Telegram, marketplaces).  
- **Credential hygiene enforcement**: mandatory password rotation, MFA everywhere, prevention of password reuse.  
- **Anomaly detection**: session replay, impossible travel, unusual browser fingerprints.  
- **User awareness**: employees understanding the **value of their credentials** in underground economies.

## Conclusion

The **outsider phase** is no longer about brute-forcing doors; it’s about walking through ones already left open by leaks and data brokers.  
For a Red Team, focusing on leaks and markets provides a **highly realistic initial access vector** — one that is **cheap, scalable, and devastatingly effective** in modern adversary simulations.
