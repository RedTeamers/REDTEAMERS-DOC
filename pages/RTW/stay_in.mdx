# The "Stay In" Phase

Red Team engagements progress through distinct stages, each designed to replicate the mindset and tradecraft of real-world adversaries. Among these, the **"Stay In" phase** is one of the most delicate and defining. It focuses on maintaining a **persistent and stealthy presence** inside the target environment after the initial breach.  

> ðŸ’¡ Where the **Get In** phase is about breaking through the door, **Stay In** is about living quietly inside the houseâ€”unnoticed, yet fully aware of your surroundings.

## Purpose and Strategic Importance

The primary objective of the "Stay In" phase is to **establish and sustain persistence**. Unlike a penetration test that often ends after the first foothold, Red Team engagements last weeks or months. Maintaining uninterrupted access is critical to set the stage for the **"Act" phase**, where meaningful operational goals (like data exfiltration or business impact) are pursued.  

From the defendersâ€™ perspective, this stage is a **stress test of resilience**. It highlights their ability to:  
- Detect hidden persistence mechanisms  
- Recognize subtle lateral movements  
- Respond effectively before damage escalates  

ðŸ“Š Metrics such as **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** and **Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)** often come into focus here. Beyond numbers, the phase offers an invaluable training ground for the Blue Team, exposing them to scenarios that mirror **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs).**

## Core Activities of the "Stay In" Phase

### 1. Internal & Domain Enumeration
Operators expand their situational awareness by answering questions like:  
- *Who has admin rights?*  
- *Where are the crown jewels stored?*  
- *Which systems communicate with each other?*  

This builds an **operational map** of trust relationships and hidden pathways.

### 2. Establishing Persistence
Persistence ensures that if one door closes, others remain open. Examples:  
- Registry run keys & scheduled tasks  
- Malicious services or startup scripts  
- Exploiting cloud authentication tokens or SSO misconfigurations  

> âœ… Good persistence is **quiet, redundant, and resilient** against routine IT changes (restarts, patching, credential resets).

### 3. Lateral Movement
Red Teams rarely stay confined to one host. Using stolen credentials or built-in trust, they move sideways, blending into legitimate user activity.

### 4. Command & Control (C2)
C2 is the **lifeline** of the Red Team:  

- **Asynchronous C2** â†’ controlled check-ins, stealthier  
- **On-demand C2** â†’ dormant channels triggered manually  
- **Tiered C2 Infrastructure**:  
  - **Tier 1 (Long Haul)** â†’ rare callbacks (24+ hrs), hidden fallback  
  - **Tier 2 (Short Haul)** â†’ medium-frequency backup  
  - **Tier 3 (Interactive)** â†’ active operations, higher risk  

Traffic must **blend with normal traffic** (HTTP/S, DNS, SMB, cloud services).  
C2 redirectors add a layer of protection, acting as **burnable buffers**.

## Why the "Stay In" Phase Is So Delicate

This stage is about balance: achieving goals **without raising alarms**.

### IOC Management
Every action leaves a trace. Skilled operators know:  
- Which artifacts their tools create  
- How to minimize footprints  
- When *not* to act to avoid exposure  

### Stealthy Tradecraft
- Live off the land (built-in tools > binaries)  
- Keep traffic mostly **internal**  
- Maintain **minimal outbound C2 paths**  
- Encrypt traffic (unless mimicking legacy cleartext)  
- Execute from **normal paths**, not `c:\temp`  
- Use exploits sparinglyâ€”pivot to stealthier methods once in  

### Exploitation Without Exploits
Persistence often comes from **misconfigurations** or **weak controls**, not just zero-days:  
- Reused passwords  
- Forgotten admin accounts  
- Excessive permissions  

### Data Handling & Ethics
Red Teams have a duty to protect client data:  
- Avoid mining sensitive PII/medical/financial data  
- Pause and notify the **Engagement Control Group (ECG)** if sensitive info is encountered  
- Apply strict controls:  
  - ðŸ”’ Encrypted storage & comms  
  - ðŸ”‘ Strong authentication  
  - ðŸ‘¥ Two-Person Integrity (TPI) for critical ops  
- Keep **comprehensive logs** (timestamps, commands, outputs, screenshots)

## Key Takeaways

The **"Stay In" phase** is where Red Team engagements truly mature. It is not only about persistenceâ€”it is about **discipline, stealth, and realism**.  

âœ… Done well, it reveals:  
- Whether defenders can catch subtle compromise traces  
- How long adversaries could remain undetected  
- How resilient the organization is against determined, persistent threats  

By surviving undetected, the Red Team provides the most valuable gift:  
a **mirror of real-world adversaries**, and the opportunity to strengthen defenses before a true attack arrives.
