# The "Act" Phase of a Red Team Engagement

After the doors have been opened in **Get In**, and the operators have learned to live quietly inside during **Stay In**, comes the most decisive moment: **Act**.  

This third and final stage of the Red Team methodology is where intent turns into **impact**. It is here that a Red Team demonstrates, in tangible and often unsettling ways, what a determined adversary could accomplish against an organization.

> ⚔️ The "Act" phase is not about proving technical skill for its own sake—it is about simulating a **real adversarial impact** to test how an organization truly stands against persistent and capable threats.

## Prerequisites Before Acting

The "Act" phase doesn’t begin in isolation—it is the **culmination of everything that came before**.

1. **Successful Completion of Previous Phases**  
   - *Get In*: Initial foothold obtained.  
   - *Stay In*: Persistence secured, stealth maintained.  
   Without both foundations, acting prematurely risks detection or collapse of the engagement.

2. **Planning and Authorization**  
   - **Rules of Engagement (ROE)** clearly define what can and cannot be done.  
   - **Engagement Control Group (ECG)** approves objectives and ensures risk is acceptable.  
   - **Trusted Agent (TA)** inside the client provides oversight, prevents collateral damage, and assists with deconfliction.  

3. **Risk Management**  
   Acting against live production systems carries weight. Every step must balance **realism** with **safety**. The Red Team Lead applies operational discipline; the ECG carries ultimate accountability.

4. **Strategic Buy-in**  
   Organizations must accept that **real insight requires real risk**. When leadership embraces full-scale simulated impacts, they gain lessons that no tabletop exercise can provide.

## Core Concepts of the "Act" Phase

### What Are Operational Impacts?
Operational impacts are **deliberate actions designed to measure how well an organization can detect, respond, and recover** when faced with a determined adversary.  

Unlike a penetration test focused on vulnerabilities, the **"Act" phase focuses on effects**:  
- How does the organization react when its crown jewels are touched?  
- Can operations continue under stress?  
- Do defenders recognize the threat in time?  

### Examples of Impacts
- **Denial of Service** on a critical application to test continuity plans  
- **Exfiltration of sensitive files** to measure data loss prevention  
- **Manipulation of ICS equipment** in an industrial context to simulate operational disruption  
- **Privilege misuse** that mimics insider threats without relying on exploits  

The key is not the sophistication of the technique, but the **realism of the impact** and the organization’s **ability to respond**.

## Timing and Execution

Operational impacts are usually performed **towards the end of the engagement**, once the Red Team has prepositioned itself to strike efficiently.  

> ⏳ Timing matters: too early, and the Blue Team may harden prematurely; too late, and there may be little room for meaningful lessons.

Impacts are always executed with precision, minimizing unnecessary noise, while ensuring that defenders face a scenario as authentic as possible.

## Why the "Act" Phase Matters

The value of this phase lies in the **mirror it holds up** to the organization:  

- It measures the **coordination between people, processes, and technology**.  
- It reveals whether alerts are noticed and acted upon.  
- It tests continuity and recovery under real stress.  
- It highlights not just vulnerabilities, but **resilience—or the lack thereof.**  

For defenders, it is muscle memory training: recognizing adversarial patterns, learning to respond under pressure, and closing gaps before a real adversary arrives.

## Documentation and Reporting

The "Act" phase must be **meticulously documented** to provide lasting value:  

- **Comprehensive Logs** → Every command, attempt, timestamp, and outcome is captured.  
- **Attack Flow Diagrams** → Visuals make the threat journey clearer than text alone.  
- **Narrative Reporting** → Rather than listing vulnerabilities, the Red Team tells the **story** of how objectives were achieved and what that reveals about defenses.  
- **Risk and Context** → Instead of generic severity scores, risk is explained in relation to organizational goals and defensive performance.  

### Two Levels of Debrief
- **Executive Outbrief** → High-level, business-focused: what was impacted, what it means for operations, and how reputation or continuity could have been affected.  
- **Technical Outbrief** → A collaborative exchange with the Blue Team: what was done, how it was detected (or not), and lessons learned from both perspectives.

## Key Takeaways

The **"Act" phase** is not a spectacle—it is the **logical conclusion** of Red Teaming. It transforms stealthy preparation into meaningful action, exposing the truth of an organization’s security posture.  

✅ It tests defenses in the only way that truly matters: **against impact.**  
✅ It provides clarity on whether systems, people, and processes can withstand a real attack.  
✅ It closes the loop of the methodology: **Get In → Stay In → Act**.  

> In the end, the "Act" phase gives leadership and defenders something invaluable:  
a **ground truth** of resilience, and a roadmap to improve before facing real-world adversaries.
