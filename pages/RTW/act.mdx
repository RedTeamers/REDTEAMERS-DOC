# About RTW

## Introduction
**RedTeamer.wiki** is a knowledge and reference project dedicated to making the concepts, methodologies, and practices of Red Teaming accessible to a wide audience of security professionals.

The main objective is to **share, document, and propagate** the notion of Red Teaming, while clearly explaining its differences from penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.  
- **Vulnerability Assessment** → Focus on identifying flaws.  
- **Penetration Testing** → Focus on exploiting those flaws.  
- **Red Teaming** → Emulates real-world threat actors to test people, processes, and technology under realistic conditions.

This project aims to:
- Provide **technical and theoretical support** for cybersecurity experts.
- Serve as a **practical guide** for structuring Red Team engagements.
- Act as a **knowledge repository** (*paper keep memory*) to preserve lessons learned and best practices.
