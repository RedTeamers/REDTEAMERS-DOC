# RTW Methodology

The **RedTeamer.wiki methodology (RTW)** is built around three fundamental principles that reflect the operational lifecycle of real-world adversaries:

1. **Get In** → Establish initial access.  
2. **Stay In** → Maintain presence and evade detection.  
3. **Act** → Execute mission objectives.

This model distills the essence of Red Teaming: not just exploiting vulnerabilities, but simulating persistent, realistic, and goal-oriented adversary behavior.

## Why This Model?

- **Simplicity**: Clear structure for planning and communication.  
- **Realism**: Inspired by how advanced threat actors operate.  
- **Coverage**: From entry to persistence and mission impact.

## Overview

### Get In
The entry point: phishing, exploiting exposed services, supply chain, or physical access.  
Focus: stealthy initial compromise that mirrors real adversaries.

### Stay In
Once inside, maintaining a foothold without triggering alarms.  
Focus: persistence, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and OPSEC.

### Act
Carrying out the objectives: data access, exfiltration, domain dominance, or impact scenarios.  
Focus: mission success and clear reporting to improve defensive posture.
