# RedTeamer.wiki — Introduction & Values

## Why RedTeamer.wiki
This site is dedicated to the **art of Red Teaming** applied to real-world operational contexts.  
No generic lists or copy-paste playbooks — every topic is addressed from a **practical**, **realistic**, and **threat-oriented** perspective.

**Goals:**
- Train practitioners to emulate real-world adversaries.
- Assess and improve human, procedural, and technical defenses.
- Close the gap between **perceived security** and **actual security**.

---

## My Perspective on Red Teaming
Red Teaming goes far beyond a penetration test or vulnerability scan:

- Accurate emulation of real-world threat actor TTPs.
- Pre-defined, strategic final objectives (data exfiltration, disruption, targeted compromise).
- Strong focus on stealth and evasion.
- Evaluation of detection and response capabilities, not just vulnerability existence.

## Key Distinctions

| Activity                | Primary Goal                                                   | Depth           | Stealth         |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Vulnerability Scanning  | Identify as many known flaws as possible over a broad scope     | Low             | Not applicable  |
| Penetration Testing     | Exploit flaws to prove access is possible                       | Medium          | Low             |
| **Red Teaming**         | Achieve a strategic goal while simulating a real-world threat   | Very High       | Essential       |

## Core Methodology

**Get In → Stay In → Act**

1. **Get In** — Gain initial access (phishing, exploitation, etc.).
2. **Stay In** — Maintain persistence, escalate privileges, move laterally.
3. **Act** — Execute the final objective (exfiltration, disruption, operational impact).

> Each stage evaluates the organization’s ability to detect and respond effectively.

---

## Engagement Models
- **Full Engagement** — No initial position; the attack starts from the outside.
- **Assumed Breach** *(often preferred)* — The Red Team starts with a pre-compromised access point, focusing efforts on testing internal defenses.

---

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Red Cell** — Offensive team.
- **Blue Cell** — Defensive team.
- **White Cell** — Oversight and arbitration.
- **ECG (Engagement Control Group)** — Executive decision-makers authorizing the engagement.

---

## Rules of Engagement (ROE)
A formal contractual document defining:
- Authorized scope and assets.
- Mission objectives.
- Permitted and prohibited actions.
- Deconfliction process to differentiate Red Team activity from a real incident.

---

## Command and Control (C2) Infrastructure
- **Redirectors** — Protect the main C2 server from exposure.
- **Tiered Architecture**:
  - **Tier 3** — Highly interactive C2, noisy, short-term use.
  - **Tier 2** — Slower callbacks, medium-term persistence.
  - **Tier 1** — Long callback intervals (days), long-term persistence and fallback beacon.

---

## Tradecraft
- Full understanding of tools and the artifacts they produce.
- Blending into normal network traffic (e.g., HTTPS on port 443).
- Minimizing operational noise to avoid detection.

---

## Reporting & Analysis
- **Findings** — Isolated technical vulnerabilities.
- **Observations** — Systemic or human weaknesses.
- **Pyramid of Pain** — Prioritize defensive measures that significantly disrupt adversary operations (focus on TTPs rather than low-value indicators).

## References & Resources
- **MITRE ATT&CK** — TTP mapping.
- **C2 Frameworks** — Cobalt Strike, Mythic, Sliver.

## Content Organization on RedTeamer.wiki
This site will go beyond theoretical explanations.  
It will feature **dedicated sections for all TTPs**, categorized according to the three core phases:

1. **Get In** — Initial access techniques.
2. **Stay In** — Persistence, lateral movement, and privilege escalation techniques.
3. **Act** — Techniques related to achieving operational objectives.

Each TTP entry will include:
- A clear and contextualized description.
- Example tools and usage scenarios.
- Associated indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Detection and mitigation strategies.
