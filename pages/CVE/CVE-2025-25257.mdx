# CVE-2025-25257 – SQLi in FortiWeb Fabric Connector leading to RCE

## Background
In July 2025, security researchers at Pwner disclosed a critical vulnerability in FortiWeb appliances.  
Tracked as **CVE-2025-25257**, this issue originates from a SQL injection in the **Fabric Connector component**, which can be escalated into **remote code execution (RCE)** with no authentication required.  

This vulnerability underscores once again how a single injection flaw, if chained properly, can lead to complete appliance compromise.

---

## Root Cause
- The `fabric_device_status-handler` endpoint processes HTTP headers (such as `Authorization`).  
- Input is concatenated directly into SQL queries without proper sanitization.  
- The SQL engine runs with elevated privileges, granting read/write capabilities on the filesystem.  
- By abusing this, an attacker can drop a malicious Python file that gets **automatically executed** by a FortiWeb CGI script.  

In short, what begins as a SQLi becomes a **pre-auth RCE** through file planting and interpreter hijacking.

---

## Exploitation Flow
1. **Send crafted HTTP request** to trigger SQL injection via headers.  
2. **Leverage DB access** to write arbitrary files on disk.  
3. **Plant malicious Python module** in a location imported by FortiWeb CGI.  
4. **Trigger CGI execution**, gaining remote code execution.  

This chain is not only practical but highly reliable once initial injection is confirmed.

---

## Impact
- Full compromise of the FortiWeb appliance.  
- Remote attackers can pivot into protected networks behind the WAF.  
- Potential interception, modification, or exfiltration of sensitive data passing through the device.  

---

## Affected Versions
- **7.6.0 → 7.6.3**  
- **7.4.0 → 7.4.7**  
- **7.2.0 → 7.2.10**  
- Any version below **7.0.11**

---

## Detection & Hunting
Defenders should look for indicators across multiple layers:  

- **HTTP logs**: suspicious `Authorization` headers containing injection patterns (`'`, `--`, `/*`, `UNION SELECT`).  
- **Database activity**: unusual queries involving `INTO OUTFILE`.  
- **File system monitoring**: unexpected creation of `.py` files in FortiWeb directories.  
- **SIEM correlation**: Fabric API calls followed by file creation and CGI execution.  

---

## Mitigation & Patching
Fortinet has released patches for all affected branches. Immediate recommendations:  

1. **Upgrade** to the latest fixed version.  
2. **Restrict exposure** of Fabric APIs to trusted networks only.  
3. **Enable file integrity monitoring** on FortiWeb directories.  
4. Consider implementing **WAF rules** temporarily to block suspicious requests until fully patched.
