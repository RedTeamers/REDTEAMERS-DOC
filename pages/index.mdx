# RedTeamer.wiki

A practical knowledge base focused on **realistic Red Team operations**: planning, adversary emulation, OPSEC, intrusion tradecraft, and reporting.  
This home page centralizes the main sections and how to use them.

## Core sections

### 1. Reconnaissance & OSINT
Objectives, collection plans, passive vs active recon, data sources, and operational safety.  
**Coverage**: domains, infrastructure, employee footprint, technology stack, breach data.  
_Temporary links to create:_  
`/recon-osint/overview` · `/recon-osint/tools` · `/recon-osint/playbooks`

### 2. Initial Access
Realistic initial footholds: exposed services, client‑side vectors, and social techniques aligned with ROE.  
**Coverage**: phishing planning, web exposures, VPN/RDP, misconfigurations, client payload delivery.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/initial-access/overview` · `/initial-access/phishing` · `/initial-access/web` · `/initial-access/infrastructure`

### 3. Privilege Escalation
Windows, Linux, and Cloud privilege escalation mapped to real SOC controls.  
**Coverage**: token abuse, Kerberos tradecraft, SUID/Sudo, cron/systemd, cloud IAM paths.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/priv-esc/windows` · `/priv-esc/linux` · `/priv-esc/cloud`

### 4. Lateral Movement
Quiet movement and pivoting while preserving objectives and OPSEC.  
**Coverage**: WinRM/WMI/SMB/RDP, SSH pivots, socks proxies, domain trusts.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/lateral-movement/techniques` · `/lateral-movement/tooling`

### 5. Persistence
Short‑lived vs durable persistence strategies that match scenario timelines.  
**Coverage**: Windows (tasks, registry, WMI), Linux (systemd/cron), cloud keys/roles.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/persistence/windows` · `/persistence/linux` · `/persistence/cloud`

### 6. OPSEC & Evasion
Planning and execution to reduce detection by EDR/SIEM/Defenders.  
**Coverage**: living‑off‑the‑land, execution chains, telemetry shaping, network fronting, cleanup.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/opsec-evasion/overview` · `/opsec-evasion/edr` · `/opsec-evasion/network`

### 7. Exfiltration
Data staging and controlled exfil with least‑noticeable channels.  
**Coverage**: packaging, encryption, HTTPS/DNS channels, timing and size controls.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/exfiltration/techniques` · `/exfiltration/tooling`

### 8. Tradecraft Library
Operator‑centric procedures, checklists, and reusable snippets.  
**Coverage**: engagement checklists, operator SOPs, command libraries, artifacts management.  
_Temporary links:_  
`/tradecraft/checklists` · `/tradecraft/sops` · `/tradecraft/commands`

## Values & editorial line

- **Realism first**: techniques that mirror credible adversaries and enterprise defenses.  
- **Operator‑oriented**: concise, reproducible, with decision points and fallback paths.  
- **OPSEC‑driven**: every page states detection risks and mitigations.  
- **Community & integrity**: responsible use, lawful testing, and clear attribution.

## Latest updates

- Initial site scaffolding and navigation.  
- Draft structure for all core sections.  
- Cheat sheet prototype for fast reference.

## Contributing

1. Follow the style guide: short intros, clear prerequisites, decision trees when relevant.  
2. For each technique, include: objective, environment assumptions, steps, detection notes, rollback/cleanup.  
3. Cross‑link related techniques and tools to reduce duplication.  
4. Submit a PR with a concise changelog entry in **Latest updates**.
