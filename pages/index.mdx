# About RTW

## Introduction
**RedTeamer.wiki** is a knowledge and reference project dedicated to making the concepts, methodologies, and practices of Red Teaming accessible to a wide audience of security professionals.


The main objective is to **share, document, and propagate** the notion of Red Teaming, while clearly explaining its differences from penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.  


### A quick reminder
<Callout type="info">
In the professional field of cybersecurity, a wide range of jargon and terminology is constantly used. These short illustrations are designed to help you cut through the noise and keep the essentials in mind.
</Callout>

- **Vulnerability Assessment** → Focus on identifying flaws.  
- **Penetration Testing** → Focus on exploiting those flaws.  
- **Red Teaming** → Emulates real-world threat actors to test people, processes, and technology under realistic conditions.

This project aims to:
- Provide **technical and theoretical support** for cybersecurity experts.
- Serve as a **practical guide** for structuring Red Team engagements.
- Act as a **knowledge repository** (*paper keep memory*) to preserve lessons learned and best practices.

## What You Will Find Here

This knowledge base is more than just documentation — it is a **comprehensive reference hub for Red Team operations**, structured to cover the entire lifecycle of offensive security engagements.  
Whether you are a professional operator, a security researcher, or an organization building resilience, here is what you will discover:

### 1. A Brief History and Purpose
**RedTeamer.wiki** was created to **consolidate Red Team knowledge** in a single place.  
In today’s cybersecurity landscape — where **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**, ransomware groups, and nation-state actors push the limits — Red Teaming has become essential to test defenses under **realistic attack conditions**.

### 2. Full Scope of Coverage
From initial planning to final reporting, the knowledge base provides guidance across all phases of an engagement:

- **Reconnaissance & OSINT**: footprinting, intelligence collection, and adversary mapping.  
- **Initial Access**: phishing, web exploitation, supply chain, and exposed service abuse.  
- **Privilege Escalation**: Windows, Linux, and Cloud privilege escalation techniques.  
- **Lateral Movement**: moving across domains and infrastructures while maintaining stealth.  
- **Persistence**: strategies to remain undetected and keep long-term access.  
- **OPSEC & Evasion**: living-off-the-land, AV/EDR bypass, and network cloaking.  
- **Exfiltration**: covert data exfil techniques (DNS tunneling, HTTPS, staged leaks).  
- **Reporting & Debrief**: methodologies to communicate findings and strengthen defenses.  

Each section is mapped to **real-world TTPs (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures)** and aligned with frameworks like **MITRE ATT&CK** to ensure operational relevance.

### 3. Core Methodology: *Get In, Stay In, Act*
The philosophy behind this project is distilled into three principles:
- **Get In** → Gain initial access, replicate real attacker entry points.  
- **Stay In** → Maintain persistence and evade detection while exploring the environment.  
- **Act** → Achieve mission objectives: privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.
